# Decision-Tree


A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. 
It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

I have created a prediction model which is used to predict the new data. It is simple to represent the data in tree structure formate.
On that,Using some libraries like,
Numpy 
Pandas
Matplotlib
Sykit learn
Seaborn and mant more.

I have mention all the steps on that:
Step-1: Importing some libraries for creating decision tree to predict the data. 
Step-2: Loading the dataset.
Step-3: Understanding the general information about the dataset.
Step-4: Check the dimension of dataset.
Step-5: Check the null values on the given dataset.
Step-6: Visualize the data in the form of pairplot.
Step-7: Extracting the data between independent and dependent Variable.
Step-8: Spliting the data into training and testing.
Step-9: Fitting Decision Tree classifier to the training data.
Step-10: Predicting the test set result.
Step-11: Creating the Confusion matrix .
Step-12: Predict the target value with best accuracy.
Step-13: Represent the "Actual data"  and "Predicted data" in seperate column.
Step-14: Load the iris data and split into two parts "iris.data" and "iris.target".
Step-15: Representing the final data in text format.
Step-16: Representing the final data in graphical format.

Then, we feed any new data to classifer and it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
